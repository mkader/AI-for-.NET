## Hello Semantic Kernel - Stateless Chat	
* https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples/tree/main/src/build-2024/01%20-%20Hello%20Semantic%20Kernel
* "Kernal" - tiny little object that contains all of your services, like chat completion or whatever, as well as functions that the AI is able to orchestrate.
* Kernel.CreateBuilder().{middle}.Build - {Middle}, I can add in some services. if I say Add, there's a whole bunch of stuff that shows up here. Like AddOpenAI|Audio/Chat/Text...
* Going to use "OpenAIChatCompletion" with use "gpt-3.5-turbo".
* While loop to do a basic chat, to print out a Q for a question and the answer
* kernel.InvokePromptAsync() - take the prompt from the user
* Run the application. 
* These models have zero memory, because it's stateless. I just made a request, got a respons.


## Program.cs
  1. It's stateless application, meaning the AI does not remember any previous interactions. Each input is treated independently.
  1. Install Semantic Kernel nuget package - Microsoft.SemanticKernel
  1. Add a model to use for chat completions -  string openAIChatCompletionModelName = "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // this could be other models like "gpt-4o".
  1. Initialize the kernel and add the OpenAI chat completion service to it - Kernel.CreateBuilder().AddOpenAIChatCompletion(openAIChatCompletionModelName,OPENAI_API_KEY)).Build();
  1. Receive the user's request and send it to the kernel to obtain a response from the LLM. -  await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(Console.ReadLine()!)
  1. Run the application `dotnet run` into the terminal. Experiment with a user prompt, similar to what is shown below. Open AI Chat
      ```console
      Q: Hi my name is Mak
      Hello Mak, pleased to meet you! How can I assist you today?
      Q: What is my name?
      I'm sorry, I cannot provide your name as I do not have that information. If you would like me to refer to you by a specific name during our conversation, please let me know.

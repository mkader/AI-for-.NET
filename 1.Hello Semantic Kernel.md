Hello Semantic Kernel - Stateless Chat	
	https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples/tree/main/src/build-2024/01%20-%20Hello%20Semantic%20Kernel
	
	"Kernal" - tiny little object that contains all of your services, like chat completion or whatever, as well as functions that the AI is able to orchestrate.

	Kernel.CreateBuilder().{middle}.Build - {Middle}, I can add in some services. if I say Add, there's a whole bunch of stuff that shows up here. Like AddOpenAI|Audio/Chat/Text...
	
	Going to use "OpenAIChatCompletion" with use "gpt-3.5-turbo".

	While loop to do a basic chat, to print out a Q for a question and the answer
	
	kernel.InvokePromptAsync() - take the prompt from the user
	
	Run the application. 
	
	These models have zero memory, because it's stateless. I just made a request, got a respons.
	
	ï»¿using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
	
	var openAIChatCompletionModelName = "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // this could be other models like "gpt-4o".
	
	var kernel = Kernel.CreateBuilder()
	    .AddOpenAIChatCompletion(openAIChatCompletionModelName, Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")) // add the OpenAI chat completion service.
	    .Build();
	
	// Basic chat
	// This is zero memory or stateless chat. The AI will not remember anything from the previous messages.
	
	while (true)
	{
	    Console.Write("Q: ");
	    Console.WriteLine(await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(Console.ReadLine()!));
	}
